# Sales Reports with Power BI and Web Scraping

## Overview

This repository contains a project I worked on during my internship, where I developed a comprehensive sales reporting system using Power BI. The project involved analyzing sales data, creating interactive visualizations, and incorporating data from web scraping to enhance the insights.

## Project Objectives

- **Sales Data Analysis**: To analyze sales data and provide actionable insights to help the business make data-driven decisions.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: To create user-friendly and interactive Power BI dashboards that visualize key sales metrics.
- **Web Scraping Integration**: To incorporate external data from web scraping into the sales reports to provide additional context and comparison.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: Used for data modeling, analysis, and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Python**: Employed for web scraping to collect additional data from various online sources.
- **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning and exploration.

## Features

- **Sales Performance Dashboard**: A dashboard that showcases sales performance across different regions, products, and time periods.
- **Web-Scraped Data Integration**: Integration of external data collected via web scraping to compare market trends with internal sales data.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Interactive filters to drill down into specific aspects of the sales data for more detailed analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Various charts, graphs, and maps to visualize sales trends, growth, and comparisons.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Power BI Files**: Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboards.
3. **Web Scraping Scripts**: Run the Python scripts provided in the `web_scraping` folder to update the data.
4. **Data Sources**: Replace the data sources with your own datasets or use the sample data provided.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.
- Learned how to incorporate external data through web scraping to enhance business reports.
- Developed skills in creating interactive and user-friendly dashboards that provide valuable insights.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Data Integration**: Incorporating real-time data streams into the dashboards.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Adding predictive analytics features using machine learning models.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Expanding the scope by integrating more external data sources.
